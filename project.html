									<h1>STAT 888 Project: High Dimensional Mediational Analysis</h1>
									<p> <b>Abstract:</b> Since its inception by Sewall Green Wright, mediation analysis has faced many criticisms and challenges. To avoid well-known limitations like inflated test statistic in Sobel's test, practitioners have been trying to adopt a stepwise procedure to mediation analysis. But due to the recent surge in using high dimensional biomarkers and omics data, the number of tests prior to the mediation analysis has become so large that we are in need of new theories that can deal with high dimensionality in mediators and exposures. In this project, I'll review both the pioneering and recent articles on high dimensional mediation analysis and share some ideas about where the future research can be directed to.</p>

								<p><b>Details:</b> Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have led to a genomic revolution where we now have tens of thousands of known gene disease association discoveries. Some people argue, knowing that a gene causes a disease is not as valuable as knowing how the gene causes the disease. For example, if the genes cause the disease by perhaps affecting some blood biomarkers. Biomarker measuring technologies have also come along a huge development recently so now there is this omics revolution more than just the genomics revolution. In this case, the blood biomarkers are mediators and the genes are exposures, both of which are high dimensional, making any prior test to simplify the composite null hypothesis (note that in a mediation analysis, the "null" hypothesis is composite, unlike other tests) quite impossible (Huang et al. 2015, Huang and Pan 2016). The regular mediation analysis will take the form of graph A above, while the high dimensional mediation analysis is of the form of graph B. </p>
								<p> Here are some challenges for the high dimensional mediation analysis. First, the mediators and often times the exposures are high dimensional and we want to separate the effects through different mediators. Second, the mediators (e.g. biomarkers) can be highly correlated. Third, the biomarkers sometimes have distributions that are not well known. Fourth, we don't know the causal ordering. Fifth, the dependence of the outcome can be difficult to model correctly and the more the biomarkers, the error can propagate. More discussions can be seen in Daniel et al. (2015). </p>
								<p> A counterfactual (or potential outcome) framework can be applied to formally define the causal effects in this case. Then the main effects to estimate would be the average natural direct effect (NDE) and the average natural indirect effect (NIE) (Song et al. 2019). However, we have to make the following assumptions to estimate these effects: 1) no unmeasured exposure-outcome confounding, 2) no unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding given the exposure, 3) no unmeasured exposure-mediator confounding, and 4) no mediator-outcome confounding affected by the exposure.</p>
