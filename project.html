									<h1>STAT 888 Project: High Dimensional Mediational Analysis</h1>
									<p> <b>Abstract:</b> Since its inception by Sewall Green Wright, mediation analysis has faced many criticisms and challenges. To avoid well-known limitations like inflated test statistic in Sobel's test, practitioners have been trying to adopt a stepwise procedure to mediation analysis. But due to the recent surge in using high dimensional biomarkers and omics data, the number of tests prior to the mediation analysis has become so large that we are in need of new theories that can deal with high dimensionality in mediators and exposures. In this project, I'll review both the pioneering and recent articles on high dimensional mediation analysis and share some ideas about where the future research can be directed to.</p>

								<p><b>Details:</b> Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have led to a genomic revolution where we now have tens of thousands of known gene disease association discoveries. Some people argue, knowing that a gene causes a disease is not as valuable as knowing how the gene causes the disease. For example, if the genes cause the disease by perhaps affecting some blood biomarkers. Biomarker measuring technologies have also come along a huge development recently so now there is this omics revolution more than just the genomics revolution. In this case, the blood biomarkers are mediators and the genes are exposures, both of which are high dimensional, making any prior test to simplify the composite null hypothesis (note that in a mediation analysis, the "null" hypothesis is composite, unlike other tests) quite impossible. </p>
