									<h1>STAT 888 Project: High Dimensional Mediational Analysis</h1>
									<p> <b>Abstract:</b> Since its inception by Sewall Green Wright, mediation analysis has faced many criticisms and challenges. To avoid well-known limitations like inflated test statistic in Sobel's test, practitioners have been trying to adopt a stepwise procedure to mediation analysis. But due to the recent surge in using high dimensional biomarkers and omics data, the number of tests prior to the mediation analysis has become so large that we are in need of new theories that can deal with high dimensionality in mediators and exposures. In this project, I'll review both the pioneering and recent articles on high dimensional mediation analysis and share some ideas about where the future research can be directed to.</p>

								<header> <b>Details</b> </header> 
								<p>Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have led to a genomic revolution where we now have tens of thousands of known gene disease association discoveries. Some people argue, knowing that a gene causes a disease is not as valuable as knowing how the gene causes the disease. For example, if the genes cause the disease by perhaps affecting some blood biomarkers. Biomarker measuring technologies have also come along a huge development recently so now there is this omics revolution more than just the genomics revolution. In this case, the blood biomarkers are mediators and the genes are exposures, both of which are high dimensional, making any prior test to simplify the composite null hypothesis (note that in a mediation analysis, the "null" hypothesis is composite, unlike other tests) quite impossible (Huang et al. 2015, Huang and Pan 2016). The regular mediation analysis will take the form of graph A above, while the high dimensional mediation analysis is of the form of graph B. </p>
								<p> Here are some challenges for the high dimensional mediation analysis. First, the mediators and often times the exposures are high dimensional and we want to separate the effects through different mediators. Second, the mediators (e.g. biomarkers) can be highly correlated. Third, the biomarkers sometimes have distributions that are not well known. Fourth, we don't know the causal ordering. Fifth, the dependence of the outcome can be difficult to model correctly and the more the biomarkers, the error can propagate. More discussions can be seen in Daniel et al. (2015). </p>
								<p> A counterfactual (or potential outcome) framework can be applied to formally define the causal effects in this case. Then the main effects to estimate would be the average natural direct effect (NDE) and the average natural indirect effect (NIE) (Song et al. 2019). However, we have to make the following assumptions to estimate these effects: 1) no unmeasured exposure-outcome confounding, 2) no unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding given the exposure, 3) no unmeasured exposure-mediator confounding, and 4) no mediator-outcome confounding affected by the exposure.</p>
								<p> In this project, I'll review some of the articles mentioned above and also the following recent articles: Guo et al. (2022): High-Dimensional Mediation Analysis for Selecting DNA Methylation Loci Mediating Childhood Trauma and Cortisol Stress Reactivity, Zhao and Luo (2016): Pathway Lasso: Estimate and Select Sparse Mediation Pathways, and Song et al. (2021): Bayesian hierarchical models for high-dimensional mediation analysis with coordinated selection of correlated mediators.</p>

                                                                <p> Let \(T\) be the treatment (or exposure) variable, \(Y\) be the outcome, and \(M\) be the mediator. In general, we will let \(M\) stand for the set of all intermediate variables (hence, high dimensional mediation) between \(T\) and \(Y\). We will use the counterfactual notation \(Y_t(u)\) to denote the value that \(Y\) would attain in unit (or situation) \(U = u\) under the control regime \(do(T = t)\). Eq. (4) in Pearl (2000a, Ch. 7) has more formal semantics of these counterfactual expressions. Many concepts associated with direct and indirect effect require comparison to a reference value of \(T\), that is, a value relative to which we measure changes. We will designate this reference value by \(t^*\).</p>
                                                                
								<header> <b>Identification of the estimands</b> </header>
								<p> Natural Direct Effects:</p>
								<p> An event \(T = t\) is said to have a natural direct effect on variable \(Y\) in situation \(U = u\) if the following inequality holds: \(Y_{t^*}(u) \ne Y_{t,M_{t^*}(u)}(u)\). In words, the value of \(Y\) under \(T = t^*\) differs from its value under \(T = t\) even when we keep \(M\) at the same value (\(M_{t^*}(u)\)) that \(M\) attains under \(T = t^*\).We can easily extend this definition from events to variables by defining \(T\) as having a natural direct effect on \(Y\) (in model \(M\) and situation \(U = u\)) if there exist two values, \(t^*\) and \(t\), that satisfy \(Y_{t^*}(u) \ne Y_{t,M_{t^*}(u)}(u)\). Note that this definition does not require that we specify a value \(m\) for \(M\); that value is determined naturally by the model, once we specify \(t\); \(t^*\), and \(u\). If one is interested in the magnitude of the natural direct effect, one can take the difference called the natural direct effect, \(NDE(t, t^*; Y, u)=Y_{t,M_{t^*}(u)}(u)-Y_{t^*}(u)\). Consequently, the average natural direct effect is given by \(NDE(t, t^*; Y, u)=E(Y_{t,M_{t^*}})-E(Y_{t^*})\). As noted in (Robins and Greenland, 1992), we cannot generally evaluate the average natural direct effect from empirical data. But Pearl (2012) showed if there exists a set \(W\) of covariates, nondescendants of \(T\) or \(M\), such that \(Y_{t,m}\) is conditionally independent of \(M_{t^*}\), given \(W\)), then the average natural direct effect is experimentally identifiable, and it is given by: 

								$$NDE(t, t^*; Y) = \sum_{w,m}[E(Y_{t,m}|w)-E(Y_{t^*,m}|w)] P(M_{t^*} = m | w)P(w).$$

								Proof:

								$$E(Y_{t,M_{t^*}}=y)=\sum_{w}\sum_{m}[E(Y_{t,m}=y|M_{t^*}=m,W=w]P(M_{t^*} = m | w=w)P(w=w)$$
								
								Using the fact that \(Y_{t,m}\) is conditionally independent of \(M_{t^*}\), given \(W\),

								$$E(Y_{t,M_{t^*}}=y)=\sum_{w}\sum_{m}[E(Y_{t,m}=y|W=w]P(M_{t^*} = m | w=w)P(w=w)$$

								Each factor in the above equation is identifiable. By law of composition, \(E(Y_{t*})=E(Y_{t^*}M_{t^*})\) and completes the proof.

								The conditional independence relation can easily be verified from the causal graph associated with the model. Using a graphical interpretation of counterfactuals, \(W\) d-separates \(Y\) from \(M\) in the graph formed by deleting all arrows emanating from \(T\) and \(M\). However, The identification of the natural direct effect from nonexperimental data requires stronger conditions. From the above we see that it is sufficient to identify the conditional probabilities of two counterfactuals: \(P(Y_{t,m}=y|W=w)\) and \(P(M_{t^*}=m|W=w)\), where \(W\) is any set of covariates (Pearl 2012).</p>

								<p>Natural Indirect Effects:</p>
								<p>Since the NDE and NIE are connected to each other via \(TE=NDE-NIE_r\) (where, \(TE\) is the total effect and \(NIE_r\) stands for the natural indirect effect under the reverse transition), all our discussions above concerning the identification of NDE should apply to NIE as well (Pearl, 2009b, p. 132; Pearl, 2009a, 2012a).</p> 

								<header> <b>Estimation</b> </header>
								<p>There are high-dimensional mediation methods jointly modeling exposure on mediator effects and mediator on outcome effects. To account for the large number of mediators, these methods either penalize mediation effects or specify particular priors on them to make the mediation model identifiable. Two types of methods belong to this category: penalization-based regression methods such as HIMA (high-dimensional mediation analysis) (Zhang, 2010) and pathway Lasso (Zhao and Luo, 2016); and Bayesian methods such as BAMA (Bayesian variable selection mediation method) (Song et al., 2020).</p> 

								<p>First, HIMA applies the sure independence screening (SIS) in the mediator-outcome model to reduce the dimensionality of mediators from ultra-high to high. Second, HIMA applies the multivariate mediator-outcome model to model the selected candidate mediators together and relies on the minimax concave penalty (MCP) to shrink the mediator on outcome effects towards zero.</p>

								$$Q_{MCP}=\dfrac{1}{2n}(Y-Xc^{'}-\sum_{j=1}^{d_1}M_jb_j-U_{XM})^T(Y-Xc^{'}-\sum_{j=1}^{d_1}M_jb_j-U_{XM})+\sum_{j=1}^{d_1}\{\lambda[|b_j|-\dfrac{|b_j|}{2\delta\lambda}]I(0 \le |b_j| \le \delta\lambda)+\dfrac{\lambda^2\delta}{2}I(|b_j|>\delta\lambda)\}$$
								<p>where \(\lambda>0\)  is the tuning parameter that controls the shrinkage and \(\delta>0\) determines the concavity of MCP. By optimizing, HIMA can select mediators that have non-zero mediator on outcome effects. The P values of testing for \(b\) for mediators with non-zero effects can be calculated as \(P_{bs}=2\{1-\Phi(\dfrac{|\hat{b}_s|}{se(\hat{b}_s)})\}, s \in S_2=\{s: \hat{b}_s \ne 0\}\) where \(\hat{b}_s\) is the MCP estimate of \(b_s\). Besides \(b\), HIMA also examines the mediator on outcome effects \(a\) in the exposure-mediator model and obtains the corresponding P values, \(P_{as}, (s = 1, \ldots, S_2)\), based on the linear regression. Finally, HIMA evaluates the significance of the mediation effect using \(P_{max,s} = max(P_{bs}, P_{as})\) and adjusts for multiple comparisons through Bonferroni correction.</p>

								<p>The pathway LASSO, on the other hand, imposes a convex Lasso-type penalty on the mediation effects. In particular, the pathway Lasso attempts to minimize the following penalized likelihood function.</p>

								$$Q_{pL}=\{\sum_{j=1}^{m}(M_j-Xa_j)^2+(Y-Xc^{'}-\sum_{j=1}^{d_1}M_jb_j)^T(Y-Xc^{'}-\sum_{j=1}^{d_1}M_jb_j)\}+\lambda_1\sum_{j=1}^{m}\{|a_jb_j|+\phi(a_j^2+b_j^2)+|a_j|+|b_j|\}$$
								<p>where \(\phi\), \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\) are tuning parameters. The first penalty aims to shrink the mediation effect as the product of \(a_j\) and \(b_j\), while the second term penalizes individual \(a_j\) and \(b_j\).</p>

								<p>BAMA is a Bayesian mediation method for selecting active mediators. BAMA specifies a Bayesian sparse linear mixed model (BSLMM) prior, also known as the two-component spike-and-slab prior, also known as the two-component spike-and-slab prior. In this project, I'll mainly focus on the first two methods.</p>
								
								<header> <b>Sensitivity analysis</b> </header>
								
								<p>Sensitivity analysis parameter:</p>
								
								<p>For each possible value \(m\) of the mediator, consider the following sensitivity analysis parameter for covariate \(C\): \(\gamma_{mc} = E[Y_{1m}|X = 1, m, c] - E[Y_{1m}|X = 0, m, c]\). So, \(\gamma_{1c} = E[Y_{11}|X = 1, M=1, c] - E[Y_{11}|X = 0, M=1, c]\) and \(\gamma_{0c} = E[Y_{10}|X = 1, M=0, c] - E[Y_{10}|X = 0, M=0, c]\). Here we will exploit this sensitivity analysis parameter \(\gamma_{mc}\) for inference about natural direct and indirect effects in the potential presence of an exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounder.</p>
								
								<p>Sensitivity analysis method:</p>
								
								<p>If the exposure is randomized, we might then proceed to attempt to estimate natural direct and indirect effect using methods, which will be consistent for natural direct and indirect effects if no-unmeasured-confounding assumptions defined in the sections above hold. Let's define,</p>
								$$Q_1=\sum_m E[Y|X = 1, m, c]\{P(m|X=1,c)-P(m|X=0,c)\},$$
								$$Q_2=\sum_m \{E[Y|X = 1, m, c]-E[Y|X = 0, m, c]\} P(m|X=0,c).$$
								<p>The expressions \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\) will be consistent for the natural indirect and direct effects, respectively, if the assumptions hold. Suppose that these assumptions do not hold but that exposure is randomized. If we had unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding variables that were not affected by exposure we could use sensitivity analysis techniques in VanderWeele (2010). However, if we have a mediator-outcome confounder that is affected by exposure, then the techniques in VanderWeele (2010) are inapplicable.</p>
								
								<p>Let's also define the bias factor for natural indirect effect, \(B^{NIE}_c\), as the difference between \(Q_1\) and the true natural indirect effect; and define the bias factor for natural direct effect, \(B^{NDE}_c\), as the difference between \(Q_2\) and the true natural direct effect; i.e.</p>
								$$B^{NIE}_c=Q_1-E[Y_{1M_1}-Y_{1M_0}|c],$$
								$$B^{NDE}_c=Q_2-E[Y_{1M_0}-Y_{0M_0}|c].$$
								<p>We then have the following results (proofs are in VanderWeele and Chiba, 2015): if \(\Gamma_c=\sum_m \gamma_{mc}P(m|X=0,c)\), then \(B^{NIE}_c=-\Gamma_c\) and \(B^{NDE}_c=\Gamma_c\). We thus have that</p>
								$$E[Y_{1M_1}-Y_{1M_0}|c]=Q_1-B^{NIE}_c,$$
								$$E[Y_{1M_0}-Y_{0M_0}|c]=Q_2-B^{NDE}_c.$$
								<p>where \(B^{NIE}_c=-B^{NDE}_c\).</p>
								
								<p>If we estimate Q1 and Q2 using methods for natural indirect and direct effects (e.g. van der Laan and Petersen, 2008; VanderWeele and Vansteelandt, 2009; Imai et al., 2010; Valeri and VanderWeele, 2012; Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser, 2012) but if the identification assumptions (1)–(4) do not hold because of unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding or an exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounding variable, then our estimators will not be consistent for the true natural indirect and direct effects. However, we can obtain corrected estimates of the natural indirect and direct effects by specifying the sensitivity analysis parameter \(\gamma_{mc}\) for each level of \(m\) (we will have two such parameters if \(M\) is binary as above) and then computing the bias factors. To obtain corrected estimates for natural indirect and direct effects we then subtract the bias factors, \(B^{NIE}_c\) and \(B^{NDE}_c\), respectively, from our estimates of the natural indirect and direct effects. The corrected estimators will be consistent for the true natural indirect and direct effects if we have specified the sensitivity analysis parameters \(\gamma_{mc}\) correctly. Of course, we do not know what the true values of these sensitivity analysis parameters are but we can vary them in a sensitivity analysis to assess the extent to which our conclusions about direct and indirect effects depend on the magnitude of these parameters.</p>
								
								<p>The sensitivity analysis parameters in Theorem 1 depend on the probabilities \(P(m|X = 0, c)\) which must be estimated from the data. This can make obtaining corrected confidence intervals for direct and indirect effect estimates more challenging. If γmc were constant across strata of \(m\) then the bias factors BNIEc and \(B^{NDE}_c\) would no longer depend on \(P(m|X = 0, c)\) and we could simply subtract \(B^{NIE}_c\) and \(B^{NDE}_c\) from both limits of the confidence intervals for \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\) to obtain corrected confidence intervals for natural indirect and direct effects respectively. Likewise, if the data set is sufficiently large so that estimates of \(P(m|X = 0, c)\) are very precise e.g. if the mediator were binary and the covariate set C empty, and the sample size large, then approximate corrected confidence intervals for natural indirect and direct effects could be obtained by simply subtracting \(B^{NIE}_c\) and \(B^{NDE}_c\) from both limits of the confidence intervals for \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\). In other contexts, however, in which we must estimate \(P(m|X = 0, c)\) from the data and our estimates of \(P(m|X = 0, c)\) are themselves subject to sampling variability, then to obtain corrected confidence intervals for natural indirect and direct effects, we could proceed by bootstrapping wherein for each fixed value of the sensitivity analysis parameters γmc and with each bootstrapped sample we would obtain both estimates of \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\) and estimates of \(P(m|X = 0, c)\) and subsequently \(B^{NIE}_c\) and \(B^{NDE}_c\) to derive a corrected estimate of the natural direct and indirect effects. Corrected confidence intervals could then be obtained by using a percentile method over the corrected estimates across the bootstrapped samples.</p>
								
								<p>Also, a corollary in VanderWeele and Chiba (2015) states that if the sensitivity analysis parameter \(\gamma_{mc}\) is non-negative for all values of \(m\), then using the observed data and estimators that are consistent for \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\), we will numerically underestimate the true natural indirect effect and numerically overestimate the true natural direct effect. Conversely, if the sensitivity analysis parameter \(\gamma_{mc}\) is non-positive for all values of \(m\), then using the observed data and estimators that are consistent for \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\), we will overestimate the true natural indirect effect and underestimate the true natural direct effect.</p>
								
								<p>Comparison with other sensitivity ananlysis techniques:</p>
								
								<p>Vansteelandt and VanderWeele (2012) also proposed a sensitivity analysis technique for an exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounder. Their technique, like that of Imai and Yamamoto (2012), requires that data is available on the exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounder, whereas the technique presented here does not. The technique of Vansteelandt and VanderWeele (2012) also involves specifying a selection bias function which can be difficult to interpret in practice, but does have the advantage that it is essentially zero so long as there is no three-way interaction between exposures, confounders and mediators.</p>
